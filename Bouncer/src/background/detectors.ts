// Multi-detector orchestration.
//
// Each detector is an independent async path that produces a hide/keep verdict.
// Detectors are ordered by priority — index 0 is highest priority. Adding a new
// path is one push() at the call site; this file doesn't change.
//
// Decision rules (evaluated in this order, but rule 1 can fire at any moment
// during the race — including after higher-priority detectors have already
// returned shouldHide=false):
//   1. As soon as ANY detector resolves with shouldHide=true, the race ends
//      with that hide result. Priority is irrelevant for hide signals — a
//      lower-priority hide overrides a higher-priority no-hide. Other
//      detectors keep running but their results are dropped.
//   2. If every detector settles without any of them saying hide, return the
//      highest-priority detector's result. If that one rejected, throw its
//      error so the pipeline's existing error handling (rate-limit, auth)
//      still fires.
//   3. Lower-priority rejections are logged and ignored.
//
// To avoid one slow detector blocking the whole evaluation, each detector can
// declare a soft timeoutMs. A timed-out detector is treated as a rejection
// for that detector only — other detectors keep running and can still resolve
// the race normally.
